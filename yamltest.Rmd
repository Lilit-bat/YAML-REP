Here is also word *bold2* and another word _bold3_ .

here is another example for `bold4`.

Here is some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
Here is an example about tesq by the rule of 4 spaces **not numbered**:

* Breakfast:
    - Food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
        
Here is an example about tesq by the rule of 4 spaces **numbered**:

1. Breakfast:
    a. Food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
        
        
Here is an example of **blockquote**:

> This is a block quote. This 
>paragraph has 2 lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote
> 2. Second item.

        
Here is an example of **nested blockquote**:

> This is a block quote. This 
>paragraph has 2 lines.
>
> > This is a list inside a block quote .

Here is an example of **code in a blockquote with 5 spaces**:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
